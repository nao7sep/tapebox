 * A downloaded macOS binary must carry a native arm64 slice — the fleet is

 * failure, not a Rosetta-tolerated fallback (managed-runtime-dependencies-
 * conventions, "Architecture correctness"). A universal (fat) binary passes; only
 * x86_64-only fails. `lipo -archs` is the inspection tool; this gate runs on the
 * staged file before it is published, so a wrong-arch build is discarded like a bad
 * checksum rather than published and left to fail at exec time.
